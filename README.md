# SuperVision
SuperVision is a projector based approach towards controlling objects inside and outside a room. 
We use Qt and OpenCV to project interfaces on objects.  
It is dependant on using ART tracker's Dtracker SDK to get the pose and orientation of a marker attached to a handheld controller. 
This information is used to understand which object you are pointing at.
